# NSIDC Solr

This is a collection of:

* SOLR schema and configuration files
* Ruby files and rake tasks to transform ISO into SOLR documents
* Rake tasks to run a SOLR instance
* Rake tasks to harvest NSIDC and ADE data
* Rake tasks to deploy a SOLR instance

#### Working on the Project

Be sure to run `bundle install`.

To set up and run your local instance of Solr, run:

* `rake build:setup`
* `rake server:start`


Manipulating data in Solr can be done with the `harvest` tasks.

* `rake harvest:ade` gathers data for the Arctic Data Explorer and inserts it into Solr.
* `rake harvest:nsidc_oia_iso` will gather data for NSIDC search.
* `rake harvest:delete_all` wipes out the database in your local Solr

Unit tests can be run with `rspec`, `rake spec:unit`, or `rake guard:specs`. Running the rake guard task will also automatically run the tests whenever the appropriate files are changed.

The style checker RuboCop can be run with `rubocop` or `rake guard:rubocop`. The rake task will also watch for ruby files (.rb, .rake, Gemfile, Guardfile, Rakefile) to be changed, and run RuboCop on the changed files.

`rake guard` will automatically run the unit tests and RuboCop in one terminal window.

Pushing with failing tests or RuboCop violations will cause the Jenkins build to break. Jenkins jobs to build and deply this project are named "NSIDC_Search_SOLR_()â€¦" and can be viewed under the [NSIDC Search tab](https://scm.nsidc.org/jenkins/view/NSIDC%20Search/).
