# NSIDC Search Solr Tools

This is a gem that contains:

* Ruby translators to transform various metadata feeds into solr documents
* A command-line utility to access/utilize the gem's translators to harvest
   metadata into a working solr instance.  

## Working on the Project

Be sure to run `bundle install`. If you encounter errors running `rake`, first
try using `bundle exec rake` to be sure you are using the right version of Rake.

To use this project, you will need a local instance of Solr 4.3, which can be
downloaded from
[Apache's archive](https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/4.3.0/). At
NSIDC, the development VM can be provisioned with the
[solr puppet module](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/puppet-solr/) to install and
configure Solr.

### Harvesting Data

The harvester requires additional metadata from services that may not yet be
publicly available, which are referenced in
lib/search_solr_tools/config/environments.yaml.

To utilize the gem, build and install the search_solr_tools gem, this will add
an executable 'search_solr_tools' to the path
(source is in lib/search_solr_tools/bin/search_solr_tools). The executable is
self-documenting, for a brief overview of what's available run the command.

Harvesting of data can be done using the 'harvest' task, giving it a list of
harvesters and an environment, deletion is possible via the 'delete_all' and/or
'delete_by_data_center' tasks.   'list harvesters' will list the valid harvest
targets.


### RuboCop

The style checker [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) can be run with
`rubocop` or `rake guard:rubocop`. The rake task will also watch for ruby files
(.rb, .rake, Gemfile, Guardfile, Rakefile) to be changed, and run RuboCop on the
changed files.

`rake guard` will automatically run the unit tests and RuboCop in one terminal
window.

RuboCop can be configured by modifying `.rubocop.yml`.

Pushing with failing tests or RuboCop violations will cause the Jenkins build to
break. Jenkins jobs to build and deply this project are named
"NSIDC_Search_SOLR_()â€¦" and can be viewed under the
[NSIDC Search tab](https://scm.nsidc.org/jenkins/view/NSIDC%20Search/).

### Testing

Unit tests can be run with `rspec`, `rake spec:unit`, or `rake guard:specs`.
Running the rake guard task will also automatically run the tests whenever the
appropriate files are changed.

Running the acceptance tests locally requires a running instance of Solr and
some data indexed:

* Use the [Solr dev VM](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/dev-vm-search). Follow the
  instructions in that project to get the VM started and running.
* `vagrant ssh` into the VM
* Clone this project, run `bundle install`
* Run `rake build:setup`
* Run `rake server:start` to start up Solr
* Run `rake dev:restart_with_clean_nsidc_harvest` to suck in the NSIDC metadata
* Once Solr has its data, `rake spec:acceptance` runs the ATs.
